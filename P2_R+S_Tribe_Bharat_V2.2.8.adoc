== 1. Abstract

This report describes the implementation of a rotating solar panel. The main aim is to provide a solution that aims to enhance the efficiency of solar panels through sustainable energy development. The proposed model utilizes engineering techniques inspired by solar tracking, similar to a sunflower, that allows for converting a stationary unidirectional solar cell to a rotatable one. This model generates more power than a conventional system without external assistance. The installation is made more accessible, thus increasing the product's scalability. With this solution, it is possible to achieve a more efficient and sustainable energy source that can contribute to the global shift towards cleaner and renewable energy sources.


The product design cycle starts with requirements, which include apparatus, rotational mechanisms, and embedded systems. Then a set of specifications is developed with the help of the given requirements. These specifications have two sub-sections, namely structural and embedded specifications. Structural includes rod specifications, solar panel holding material specifications, disk-shaped base material specifications, and gears specifications. Embedded specifications include microprocessors, motors, and sensor specifications. There is a mention of material costs at wholesale prices.

Our product is based on a 60-cell solar panel. All calculations have been done likewise. The average dimensions of a 60-cell solar panel are about 65” x 40” x 1.5”. The weight of a 60-cell solar panel ranges from 18 to 23 kg, which again depends on the manufacturer.

=== 3.1 Rotational Apparatus


*Dual Axis of Freedom:* 

* Dual-axis solar trackers adjust the angle of solar panels in two dimensions, resulting in higher efficiency than single-axis trackers. They produce 45-50% more power annually compared to stationary panels.

* The solar trackers must rotate from -180^o^ to 180^o^ to maintain an optimal angle to the sun throughout the day and year, resulting in higher power output than fixed-tilt or single-axis solar panels. 



*Efficient Motors:* 

* A maximum of two motors would be required. One would rotate the panel on the horizontal axis and the other across the vertical axis.

* We can also create a manual apparatus for horizontal movement because two motors are costly and it will consume more power.

* The power requirements for the motors should be low. RPH (rotations per hour) required for each horizontal and vertical axis motor would be a minimum of 0.088. The motor should produce a minimum torque of 0.1N-m. 

* They should require low maintenance and must not wear out quickly.

* They should be easy to control with a simple digital signal for convenience.

*Economical to manufacture:*

* The parts for the rotational apparatus should be economical to manufacture. 

* Various parts, such as the motor and gears, should be inexpensive to avoid heavy production costs. 

* Spur gears may deliver excellent efficiency at low speeds and are straightforward and inexpensive. 

*Controllers:* 

* Arduino can be used to control the motor's speed and direction of rotation. 
* By using light sensors or GPS modules, an Arduino can determine the sun's position and adjust the solar panel's angle and orientation to ensure that it is always facing the sun.

=== 3.2 Apparatus


*Mounting material:*  

* Stainless steel, aluminium, and galvalume are commonly used for solar mounting structures. Mounting racks can also be made from different materials. 

* Many manufacturers use aluminium due to its low weight, corrosion resistance, strength, and compatibility with solar module frames made of aluminium. It’s important to know about the material of the mounting structures to avoid post-project issues. 

* It's important to consider factors such as the weight and size of the solar panel, the wind and snow loads at the installation location, and any local building codes or regulations that may apply.

* These factors will help determine the appropriate dimensions and materials for the mounting system to ensure it is strong, stable, and safe. 

*Structural Strength:* 

* The structure should at least satisfy a minimum ASCE 7-10 safety standards threshold. It should be able to handle a wind load of about 200 N and a torque of 0.1 N-m. 

* We will require strong enough rods for them to support this structure. They should be corrosion-resistant and lightweight.

*Cost-effective:*

* The apparatus should be economical to manufacture. The material for mounting structures should be inexpensive to avoid high production costs. 

* Plastic-made mounting racks can be a viable option for structure mounting.

=== 3.3 Embedded Systems


*Micro-processors:*

* We intend to use a microcontroller like Atmega328, capable of running at low power, and simultaneously able to control and analyse incoming analog data from multiple sensors, hence computing solar direction.

* It should be able to give instructions to the motor driver for precise movements, hence able to output PWM signals to the motor controller. 

*Sensors:*

* Photoresistors / Light dependent resistors are generally used to detect light. Analysing their analog output gives us the direction of direct sunlight. 

* We require sensors consuming low voltage and power and ability to generate analog output based on the sun's intensity. 

* GPS technology can also be utilized to determine the exact latitude and longitude of the solar panel’s location. This can be used with RTC IC to estimate the sun's relative position to the solar panel’s position.

=== 4.1 Structural Specifications

==== 4.1.1 Vertical Rod Material
The vertical rod has to withstand a weight of about 19 Kg of the solar panel, the weight of the L-shaped column (where the solar panel will rest) and the torque that the whole system will exert, as it will be at some distance from the neutral axis.
The rod also should be able to withstand torque exerted by winds and the additional weight caused to surroundings and environment, like the weight of snow and dust.

Steel with protective coating and aluminium are the best options available for this.
Steel, being strong and durable, require a protective coating, whereas aluminium, being lightweight and corrosion-resistant, needs to have more thickness than steel.

The rod will be cylindrical, with dimensions as follow.

* The length must be at least 6 feet.
* The diameter of the rod must be at least 2 inches.

The weight of such a rod of aluminium is about 9.85 kg, and that of steel is about 28 kg.

We choose aluminium as our rod material.

==== 4.1.2 Base Material


The base would be a hollow cylinder with gears in its inner circle on the lower base, which is placed near ground, and the circular disk above it helps stabilize the rod against torque.

.*Design Considerations:* +
* Strength and Stability: The mounting system must be solid and stable enough to support the solar panel's weight and withstand external forces, such as wind and snow.

* Ease of Installation: The design should be simple and easy to install, requiring minimal tools and expertise. 

* Flexibility: The design should be flexible enough to accommodate different sizes and types of solar panels and other installation locations and environments. 

*Maintenance:* The design should allow for easy maintenance and repair, if necessary.

.*Material Considerations:* +
* Durability: The base material should be solid and durable enough to withstand harsh weather conditions and prevent corrosion over time.

* Weight: The base material should be lightweight enough to make the mounting system easy to transport and install. 

* Cost: The base material should be affordable and within budget while providing strength and durability. 

* Availability: The base material should be readily available and accessible for sourcing and manufacturing.

Based on these considerations, some potential base materials for a cylindrical solar panel mounting system include aluminium or stainless steel. Both materials are strong, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant, making them ideal for outdoor applications. Additionally, they are widely available and can be sourced at a reasonable cost.

In terms of design, a simple and effective approach could be to use a series of aluminium or steel poles arranged in a circular pattern, with brackets or clamps at the top to hold the solar panel in place. This design would provide stability and flexibility while being easy to install and maintain.

The torque exerted by the solar panel and L-shaped column is more than 150 Nm. Considering torque exerted by winds and environmental factors, the radius of the base must be at least 0.5 m.


    * Base radius : 60 cm +
	* Width of base material : 0.5 cm +
	* Height : 30 cm
 
The material we choose for this will be steel as we need a material with high strength.
 


==== 4.1.3 L-shaped Holding Material


Our product is based for Solar panel of dimensions 1.65 m x 1.0 m .

.Taking into account the different latitudes, this panel can be placed in India, 
* For the vertical plate of the L-shaped structure, +
	Height : 1.75 m +
	Width : 1.2 m +
	Thickness : 1 cm
* For the horizontal plate of the L-shaped structure, +
	Height : 1.4 m +
	Width : 1.2 m + 
	Thickness : 1 cm


.We need a material with the following factors:
* Durability: This should be solid and durable to withstand windy weather conditions and prevent corrosion over time.

* Weight: It should be lightweight.

* Cost: It should be affordable without compromising other factors.
* Availability: Depending on the above factors, aluminium and stainless steel can be used. Due to its lightweight and corrosive resistance, aluminium is a good choice for this.





==== 4.1.4 Gear and Ball Bearings


*Material of Ball Bearing:* SAE 52100 steel is the industry standard for bearing courses.
Chromium steel (SAE 52100) contains 1% carbon and 1.5% chromium. Plastic, porcelain, and even stainless steel can all be used to create bearings. In addition to its high strength, SAE 52100 also has high elasticity, high machinability, and high consistency. AISI 440C stainless steel, prized for its resistance to corrosion, is another frequently employed substance. AISI 440C has higher machining costs and lower weight capacities than 52100. 440C's strength is equal to 85 percent of 52100's at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. To lessen bearing disturbance or lengthen fatigue life, other martensitic stainless steels are also employed.

*Dimensions:* Given the inputs from the rod sub-vertical, taking the rod diameter as 2 inches, the ball bearings could have an internal diameter bigger than 2 inches considering the friction. 

*Material for Gears:* We have worked with all of these materials over the years, though steel is by far the most prevalent. For our purposes, steel is ideal because of its low cost, high strength-to-weight ratio, high resilience to wear, and potential for further improvement via heat treatment.

=== 4.2 Embedded Systems Specifications

==== 4.2.1 Microcontrollers
Texas Instruments (TI) MCUs are 16-bit RISC-based mixed-signal processors made with minimal power consumption in mind. Our product requirements state that the microcontroller must be capable of handling thousands of different tasks while remaining inexpensive, simple to program, and light on power usage. MSP430 meets all of the requirements, so it's a good fit for our offering.

==== 4.2.3 Sensor
Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), also known as photoresistors, are passive components that change their resistance in response to changes in the amount of light falling on them. LDRs are commonly used in solar trackers to detect the position of the sun and adjust the orientation of solar panels accordingly.

The specific LDR chosen for a given application will depend on factors such as the required resistance range, peak sensitivity, and maximum voltage, as well as the availability and cost of the component.
Some commonly used LDRs in solar trackers include the GL55xx series, SFH 5711 and SFH 5712 series, RP-L7014 and RP-L7024 series, and VTD series.

The GL55xx series LDRs have the following properties:

*	Max and min resistance: The GL5528 has a resistance range of 1kΩ to 10kΩ, while the GL5537 has a range of 10kΩ to 500kΩ.

*	The dark resistance of the GL55xx series LDRs decreases over time when exposed to light. This can be compensated for with circuitry or software.

*	Max power dissipation: The GL55xx series LDRs can handle a maximum power dissipation of 100mW.

*	Max voltage: The maximum voltage that can be applied to the GL55xx series LDRs is 150V DC.

*	Peak wavelength: The peak sensitivity of the GL5528 is around 540nm, while the GL5537 is around 700nm.

*	The GL55xx series LDRs are rated for operation up to a maximum temperature of 85°C. Exceeding this temperature can cause damage to the device.

*	Temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR): This is a measure of how much the resistance of the LDR changes with temperature. The GL55xx series LDRs have a TCR of about -0.5%/°C.

*	Rise and fall times: These are measures of how quickly the LDR can respond to changes in light levels. The rise time is the time it takes for the LDR to go from 10% to 90% of its final resistance when the light level changes from dark to light, and the fall time is the time it takes for the LDR to go from 90% to 10% of its final resistance when the light level changes from light to dark. The rise and fall times of the GL55xx series LDRs depend on the specific model and range from a few milliseconds to several hundred milliseconds.

*	Spectral response: This is a measure of how sensitive the LDR is to the light of different wavelengths. The GL55xx series LDRs have a peak spectral response in the visible range (around 550 nm) and are less sensitive to light outside of this range.

*	Operating temperature range: The GL55xx series LDRs can typically operate over a wide temperature range, from -40°C to 85°C.

*	Package type: The GL55xx series LDRs come in a variety of package types, including through-hole, surface mount, and radial leaded packages.
